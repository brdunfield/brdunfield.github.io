# Nier Replicant

SOUNDTRACK
Keiichi Okabe

City of Commerce, Repose, Prestigious Mask, Kain√© (Salvation)

Extremely emotional soundtrack, with layered instruments and haunting vocals.
An interesting fact about the languages used in most of the song lyrics:
They invented languages that would approximate what our current european languages would sound like in a couple thousand years after language shifts and changes - it wouldn't be understandable anymore.
They also did this with the language spoken by the People of the Mask, but with Japanese. It _sounds_ like Japanese, but it's gibberish.
