  <h1>Genshin Impact Kamisato Ayato Story Quest</h1>
<p>Sure Genshin Impact isn't a bastion of equality, but this is the first questline that's making me actively upset. The premise of the questline is this: In one of the countries in the game, the government is effectively made up of three &quot;commissions&quot;, each generally lead by a family clan. The acting leaders of two of these commissions, a young man and a young woman, have fallen in love. They are being manipulated into being married. If they do marry, the young woman will enter the clan of her new husband, therefore leaving a vacancy at the head of her commission. The questline involves trying to convince the young lady to wait on the marriage, until a more politically appropriate time that would not put her house in danger.</p>
<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>Now I don't doubt there is an interesting political story that could be told about the implications of two great houses merging in such a way. But why is it just a foregone conclusion that the woman will lose all her power and status because she gets married? It's 2022 ffs. And why is the focus on the young woman &quot;allowing&quot; herself to be manipulated, and not the young man who was equally manipulated into proposing?? Why is HIS house not in danger??</p>
<p>I am just so incredibly exhausted of video games continuing to beat me over the head with how inferior they think women are to men.</p>
