# Genshin Impact Kamisato Ayato Story Quest

Sure Genshin Impact isn't a bastion of equality, but this is the first questline that's making me actively upset. The premise of the questline is this: In one of the countries in the game, the government is effectively made up of three "commissions", each generally lead by a family clan. The acting leaders of two of these commissions, a young man and a young woman, have fallen in love. They are being manipulated into being married. If they do marry, the young woman will enter the clan of her new husband, therefore leaving a vacancy at the head of her commission. The questline involves trying to convince the young lady to wait on the marriage, until a more politically appropriate time that would not put her house in danger.

*sigh*

Now I don't doubt there is an interesting political story that could be told about the implications of two great houses merging in such a way. But why is it just a foregone conclusion that the woman will lose all her power and status because she gets married? It's 2022 ffs. And why is the focus on the young woman "allowing" herself to be manipulated, and not the young man who was equally manipulated into proposing?? Why is HIS house not in danger??

I am just so incredibly exhausted of video games continuing to beat me over the head with how inferior they think women are to men.
