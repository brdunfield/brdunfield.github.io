# A Quick Note about Tales of Arise 

As a game, Tales of Arise is generally solid all around. It’s not the best game of 2021, but it was good enough for me to finish it, and gather 100% of its achievements (which are admittedly much easier than most JRPGs to acquire).

I would argue that Tales of Arise has some of the most adult and mature cast of characters that I’ve seen in almost any video game, let alone a JRPG. What Tales of Arise does differently is that it has characters who are not afraid to call out when one of their companions has made a mistake. What’s even better is that the person who made the mistake isn’t afraid to own up to it, and apologize. What’s even BETTER is that this holds true even when it is a male character apologizing to a female character.

There are multiple instances where a female character (particularly Shionne and Rinwell) is emotionally hurt by something a male character did insensitively, and explains how her lived experience made it a hurtful act. The male characters almost without exception own their mistake, apologize, and actually *listen* to what the woman has told them, and do their best to modify their behaviour going forward. And they actually do! We see these characters actually implement and stand by these new behaviours.

This is not to say the female characters are perfect. Both Shionne and Rinwell mentioned above have several problematic beliefs and behaviours, and they are also addressed by their companions through the game. But this cast is so willing to own up to mistakes across the board, truly listen to the person they hurt, and make a genuine effort to improve their behaviour in order to avoid hurting them again. To me this is groundbreaking to see in a video game. Seeing this kind of behaviour become more and more normalized in the cultural space is a dream come true.
