  <h1>Star Ocean: First Departure R</h1>
<p>Released: 2019
Played on: Nintendo Switch</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was a great little game.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short playtime (~20 hours for one playthrough)</li>
<li>Replayability (multiple paths and characters to recruit)</li>
<li>Music - Classic Motoi Sakuraba</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random difficulty spikes that require grinding out 5-10 levels in order to progress. Most notably upon reaching the third continent, and for the final boss.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I had purchased Star Ocean FDR on a sale within the last couple of months. Reviews were decent, it looked fun, and it was only 10 dollars, so I impulse bought it. I had just finished Nier Replicant ver 1.22, and was still waiting for the Geofront fan translation of Trails to Azure which was imminent. The internet told me Star Ocean would be a relatively quick playthrough, at under 30 hours, so it seemed perfect.</p>
<p>I recently had put down FF6 because the load times on my Vita and lack of QoL were just making it impossible to continue without getting frustrated. So I was a little hesitant about picking up another game from that era. Star Ocean: First Departure R is a port of a PSP remake of a SNES game. I haven't played the original to compare, but the First Departure remake improvements meant I didn't have any QoL trouble like I did with FF6. The game played very smoothly and didn't feel all that dated. A couple exceptions are the long spell animations that can't be skipped, and a few random difficulty spikes that necessitated grinding to get around.</p>
<p>The game features a fantastic soundtrack from Motoi Sakuraba, one of my favourite video game composers, from during his golden age. It also features full voice acting for most cutscenes, beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds and sprite characters. I played the game on the Switch, almost exclusively in portable mode, although I did play one session docked to my TV, and the graphics held up well.</p>
<p>The story started out strong, but petered out with time, and the entire final arc felt very contrived to me. That's about as spoiler free as I can make it. The game has a lot of replayability baked in. From around a little over a dozen playable characters, only 8 can be recruited in any single playthrough. Each character has their own story branches and sidequests associated with them, so to see all the content you need to play the game two or three times.</p>
<p>I admittedly only had the time for one playthrough, and only did a small amount of the side content. I wanted to make sure I beat it before Trails to Azure released, so I was on a bit of a schedule. It was definitely worth the time though, and I think I will definitely pick it up for a second playthrough in the future.</p>
