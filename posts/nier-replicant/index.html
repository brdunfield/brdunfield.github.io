  <h1>Nier Replicant</h1>
<p>SOUNDTRACK
Keiichi Okabe</p>
<p>City of Commerce, Repose, Prestigious Mask, Kain√© (Salvation)</p>
<p>Extremely emotional soundtrack, with layered instruments and haunting vocals.
An interesting fact about the languages used in most of the song lyrics:
They invented languages that would approximate what our current european languages would sound like in a couple thousand years after language shifts and changes - it wouldn't be understandable anymore.
They also did this with the language spoken by the People of the Mask, but with Japanese. It <em>sounds</em> like Japanese, but it's gibberish.</p>
